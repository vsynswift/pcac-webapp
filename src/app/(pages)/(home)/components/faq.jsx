                The main difference is that the core components from Flowbite
                are open source under the MIT license, whereas Tailwind UI is a
                paid product. Another difference is that Flowbite relies on
                smaller and standalone components, whereas Tailwind UI offers
                sections of pages.
              </p>
              <p className="mb-2 text-gray-500 dark:text-gray-400">
                However, we actually recommend using both Flowbite, Flowbite
                Pro, and even Tailwind UI as there is no technical reason
                stopping you from using the best of two worlds.
